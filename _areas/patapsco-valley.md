*Summary from the [Patapsco Heritage Area Management Plan](http://friendsofpatapsco.org/MP.html), February 15, 2015.*

For over 200 years, the Patapsco Valley has been the focal point for historic events and scientific advances that have transformed Maryland and the nation. Beginning in 1995, the Patapsco Heritage Greenway Committee sought to preserve and interpret the resources of the valley, from Ellicott City and Oella to Elkridge. In 1997, the Patapsco Heritage Greenway Committee acted to create the Patapsco Valley Heritage Greenway and to achieve its status as a recognized state heritage area through the Maryland Heritage Areas Program. In the ensuing years, the Patapsco Heritage Greenway, Inc. (also operating under the name of the Friends of the Patapsco Valley Heritage Greenway) assumed management responsibility for the recognized heritage area, organizing and hosting projects, programs and special events to celebrate, preserve, protect, and conserve the valleyâ€™s historic, cultural, archeological, natural, and recreation resources. These activities have involved a wide array of heritage partners and engaged thousands of volunteers in local communities.

<!--  The Patapsco Valley, its heritage, and its communities hold a special place in the hearts of many. We honor founder Charles Wagandt for his 1980s visionary foresight of the greenway and past president Kit Valentine, in memoriam, whose faithful allegiance made the dream a reality. We dedicate this Patapsco Heritage Area Management Plan, a twenty-year labor of love, to the unwavering commitment of our numerous volunteers. -->
