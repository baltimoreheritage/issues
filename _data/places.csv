The two residences at 1124 & 1126 Riverside Avenue are the only extant one and one-half story high brick houses of their era in Baltimore City. The houses feature little ornamentation representing early vernacular design. A single door opening and window were originally located on the first floor of each house surmounted by a gable roof with central gable dormer windows. From these simple beginnings the Baltimore rowhouse evolved into larger and more elaborate structures throughout Baltimore. The two dwellings have been converted into a single house. ,,c. 1800,,T,Building,,,,Federal (vernacular),1,,,checked,,chap:83,,,,Riverside Ave,,http://www.openstreetmap.org/query?lat=39.27669107&lon=-76.60905534#map=19/39.27669107/-76.60905534,,,,CHAP Landmarks List (Revised),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Baltimore City,MD,,,,,,,,,Federal Hill South Historic District,F,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The firm is named for its founder, an Irish linen merchant who immigrated to America at the turn-of-the-19th century. Realizing the increasing demand for commercial underwriting, he began the investment house in 1800. It was the oldest banking house in the country and one that grew from local origins to have international influence. In the late 1990s, it merged with Deutche Bank. Brick, stone and copper were used for exterior construction. The building’s style is a synthesis of two revival styles, the Georgian and Renaissance. A central stained-glass dome and marble columns dominate the interior. Bronze and copper tiles embellish the floor. The structure was the first in the country to be heated with electricity. As the first to be designed by the local firm of Parker & Thomas, the building forecast other distinguished designs by the firm including the Belvedere Hotel, the Savings Bank of Baltimore, and the Hansa Haus.

The first brewery on the site was erected in 1863 by John Frederick Wiessner on land leased from Charles Rogers. At the time, there were 21 other breweries in Baltimore City and Baltimore County combined. Wiessner’s brewery was a great success and the business quickly outgrew the original building. The present structure was built in 1887 to enlarge and modernize the brewery. It was one of the finest in the state and continued to operate until Prohibition. The Wiessners unsuccessfully attempted to brew “near-beer”, 3.2% alcohol by volume, but, in 1931 they were forced to sell the brewery to the FitzSimmons family who owned the American Malt Company. In 1933 they amended their company charter to create the American Brewery, Inc., which produced beer and malt until the plant closed in 1973. The brewery is a unique example of 19th-century Victorian architecture. Its height and organization of interior were predetermined by the requirements of brewing but its exterior details are expressions of the age and of the people who lived and worked in the area. The building has been adpatively reused as offices for a non-profit human services agency, Humanim. The rehabilitation project won numerous awards at the local and state levels from preservation, community development, architect, housing, journalism, land use, and building organizations.

Her father was a prominent physician and her mother was a studied singer and pianist. She studied music with W. Llewellyn Wilson at Douglass High School and played lead roles in many of the musical productions. She was denied admission at the Peabody School of Music due to her race, but with the encouragement of Constance Black, wife of the Baltimore Sun owner, Brown entered Julliard School of Music at the age of 16. Several years later, she auditioned for George Gershwin’s almost completed musical Porgy. He was so enthralled with her talent that he rewrote the play for her character Bess to sing the lullaby ‘Summertime’ and subsequently renamed the opera Porgy and Bess.  While on a European Tour in 1948, she married Norwegian gold-medal ski jumper Thorleif Schkelderup, and became a citizen of Norway. In the mid 1950s she developed asthma and turned her talents to teaching.

Incorporated in 1912 by Raymond Coates, Jeremiah Hill and Samuel Barney, its constitution stated that the purpose of the club was “for social, moral and intellectual uplift of its members and in order that charity may be practiced in a Christian-like spirit and true friendship and brotherly love promoted and maintained.” By the 1910s, Baltimore City found itself more segregated physically than anytime before, limiting the social, economic and cultural activities of all Baltimoreans in a way they could not be separated. The Arch Social Club was the outcome of several African Americans whose determination created an organization that could lend respite and recreation to the African American community with no regard to class distinction and a space for the economic, social and cultural networks to come together.

Fowler was a master of synthesizing diverse architectural styles. His designs range from the stark purity of Classical architecture, as in the War Memorial, to the electric asymmetrical massing of the Ascot House.

For its first fifty years, at previous locations, it was the only high school in Baltimore exclusively for boys. As the demand for high school education in Baltimore increased in the early 20th century, community-based high schools were built, yet Baltimore City College remained an elite high school providing classical education for Baltimore’s best students. Many noteworthy 20th-century leaders attended school here, including Maryland governors, Congressional representatives, Baltimore City mayors, as well as numerous judges, civic leaders, artists and military heroes. Many of these individuals later wrote that their education at Baltimore City College played a significant role in their success. The current building, the four-story “Castle on a Hill”, was constructed in 1926 by Riggin Buckler and G. Corner Fenhagen as a result of an architectural competition among Maryland’s finest architects. It was the most expensive school built at the time, costing almost three million dollars. It is Baltimore’s best example of Collegiate Gothic design, featuring many distinctive details unique for local high school buildings, such as the 150-foot clock tower at its center. Today Baltimore City College remains at the forefront of local high schools. It was recognized as a “Blue Ribbon” school by the U.S. Department of Education with 95% of its graduates going on to post-secondary education.",,1926,,T,Building,Buckler & Fenhagen (Riggin Buckler and G.

""The structure is an ornament to the City and a monument to the honest administration of public affairs.

Pope was the most prominent American architect of Neoclassical buildings in the early 20th century. The museum was built on six acres of ground donated by the neighboring Johns Hopkins University and financed by a $1,000,000 municipal building loan. The major feature of the original building is a terraced stairway leading to a pedimented portico supported by six Ionic columns, all of limestone. In 1936, Pope designed the Jacobs Wing, the Antioch Court, and the auditorium. In the 1950s, the May, Woodward, and Cone Wings were added by Robert E. Lewis, and Francis H. Jencks of the Baltimore architectural firm of Wrenn, Lewis, and Jencks. The Museum’s collection is considered to be one of the finest in the country. A new wing of the museum was recently constructed, as well as the addition of the Wurtzberger Sculpture Garden. Oakland Spring House is one of three remaining structures in Baltimore designed by Benjamin H. Latrobe, architect of the United States Capitol. The pristine Neo-Classical Spring House originally stood on the grounds of Oakland, Harper’s estate which is now part of Roland Park.  Harper, a United States Senator from Maryland and son-in-law of Charles Carroll of Carrollton, was a friend of Latrobe. In 1931, when its original site was slated for residential development, the Spring House was moved to the grounds of the Baltimore Museum of Art, where it is used for garden equipment storage.

Ten Provincial and three Plenary Councils have been held in the Basilica, and thirty bishops have been consecrated there.

The 35 modest modern brick townhomes are located in two blocks. They are arranged in three staggered rows, backing up to a shared elliptical green space. Jacobsen’s design is in scale with the many surrounding historic and modern row houses. The architectural features of Bolton Square offer a comparable aesthetic to the adjacent historic row houses.

Emerson, who also built the Emerson Hotel, the Emersonian Apartments and the Brookland Farm Dairy. The tower was topped with a large replica of the Bromo Seltzer bottle which was illuminated at night and became a notable landmark for ships entering the Baltimore harbor. This bottle was removed in the 1930s, but the clock, the largest four-dial gravity clock in the world, remains. The Tower now houses artist studios.

The Gothic Revival style building is the congregation’s second church building, designed by renowned Baltimore architect Charles L. Carson and built by prominent Baltimore builder Benjamin F. Bennett in 1883/1884. The church was named the Canton Methodist Episcopal Church, and by the late 20th century, it was known as the Canton United Methodist Church. The congregation voted to disband in 2006. In 2007, this 2 ½ story Gothic Revival building was damaged by a fire.

It stands on what was once a vast tract owned by Charles Carroll of Carrollton. Carroll was one of the four Maryland signers of the Declaration of Independence, a member of the General Assembly, a United States Senator, and a very wealthy land owner. From 1803 to 1809, the property was owned by Bernard Sourzac, one of several French immigrants from Haiti who settled in Mount Washington in the early 1800s. Years later, in the mid-19th century, the property formed part of a light industrial complex of snuff and tobacco mills along the Western Run. The great flood of 1868 caused much damage to the mill property, and this imposing structure is the one surviving building. It is an excellent example of Maryland 18th-century vernacular architecture in its symmetry and simplicity; the roughness and heaviness of its construction suggests how remote this area was, at that time, from Baltimore.

Charles Carroll of Carrollton, last surviving signer of the Declaration of Independence, bought the house from Christopher Deshon in 1822 in the name of his daughter, Mary, and her husband, Richard Caton. Mr. Caton, a merchant-banker, used it as both a dwelling and an office. The ""counting-house"" on the ground floor still has the original safe with steel door paneled to match the wooden moulding of the room. The elder patriarch, the most famous and wealthy Marylander of his time, made his winter home here during the last decade of his life. Many distinguished visitors paid their respects to him here, as recorded in published travel accounts. Carroll died in this building in 1832. The house was deeded in trust to his daughter Mary Caton and her daughter, Emily. Until 1914, when the building was purchased by the City of Baltimore on the occasion of the Star Spangled Banner Centennial, the Carroll Mansion was used for various businesses. As City property, it housed Baltimore's first Vocational School and later Baltimore's first recreation center. The Carroll Mansion was operated as part of the privately incorporated City Life Museums which merged with the Maryland Historical Society. Since 2002, it has been home to Carroll Museums, an educational and preservation non-profit. The Carroll Mansion Complex was expanded in 2002 to include several structures. In the 1980s and 1990s, the entire block was consolidated as “Museum Row” and served as the campus of the City Life Museum. The buildings in the block which were added to the Carroll Mansion Complex Landmark include the Fava Fruit structure, the cast iron façade of which was originally constructed in 1869 on a site near the present-day Convention Center. The building was dismantled in 1976, and reconstructed on this site in the 1990s. The building adjacent to the Carroll Mansion is a reconstruction of a Federal-era home, and the inclusion of it in the designation ensures compatibility with the adjacent Carroll Mansion. The 1840s House, a group of several small houses connected together, comprise an authentic historic block. This now serves as a Bed & Breakfast.",,1811,,T,Building,,Dwelling,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carroll_Mansion,Federal,6,27,,checked,,chap:7,,,,S.

It was built in 1927 by master architect Laurence Hall Fowler for multi-millionaire Alexander Duncan, founder of the Commercial Credit Corporation, Maryland’s second billion-dollar business. As a result of the expansion of Baltimore’s city boundaries in 1918, developers and homeowners began to desire a mix of urban and rural amenities into a suburban utopia; thus, new neighborhoods like Blythewood, where Cedarwood is located, were designed with the resources to support the Suburban ideal. For Cedarwood’s “French Eclectic” style, Fowler combined his well-educated understanding of architectural history to build a modern house garbed in Old World Landmark motifs. Its stone façade, slate roof and landscaping, as well as being setback from the street, emphasize its nature as a ‘retreat’. Cedarwood stands as one of the most opulent examples of how landscape and architecture captured 1920s suburban design and desire, and is emblematic of Baltimore’s vision of the Suburban ideal.

In 1903 the City Passenger Railway was sold to the United Railways and Electric Company, which built the extension between 1911-1914. Here the facility was used as a bus garage by the United Railways and Electric Company which converted the area from a cable trolley system to electric cars. In 1939, the garage was rehabbed into the Times Theater, Baltimore’s first newsreel theater and Famous Ballroom. The Famous Ballroom was used for many events during the 1940s to 1960s.

In 1904, Philadelphia architect John D. Allen designed the Congress Hotel - originally the Hotel Kernan - as part of a million dollar entertainment complex which also included the Maryland Theater and the Auditorium Theater. From 1905 until the late 1920s, Kernan’s multimillion-dollar triple extravaganza was a focal point of Baltimore’s social life. The complex touted many family-orientated vaudeville acts as well as elegant dining, after-hours supper parties, private banquets, an enormous ‘rathskeller’ which has Baltimore’s longest marble bar, and 150 luxurious rooms. The richly detailed architecture is French Renaissance Revival, and the hotel is one of two remaining early-20th-century palace hotels.

Burnham, a noted Chicago architect of Commercial Style buildings and early skyscrapers. Burnham designed many important office buildings in Chicago and elsewhere, including the Flat Iron Building in New York and Union Staton in Washington, D.C. He was an important figure in the Columbia Exposition of 1893 and was responsible for the civic improvement plan for Chicago in 1909, a landmark in the development of modern city planning. The Continental Building was the tallest building in Baltimore when it was constructed in 1901 for the Continental Trust. It features Commercial Style architecture with some classical Renaissance Revival details. It was also one of the few buildings to survive the Baltimore Fire of 1904. The interior was incinerated, but no major structural damage was done to the exterior walls, and the building was quickly rehabilitated after the fire. The major alteration to the building since 1904 was the removal of most of the cornice and decorative frieze.

The estate was built by Thomas de Kay Winans, whose family was commissioned by Czar Nicholas I to construct the Moscow-St. Petersburg rail system. Crimea’s namesake is a Russian peninsula. Thomas Winans was the son of Ross Winans, a locally prominent rail magnate and State legislator. The family constructed and navigated the derisively named “Cigar Boat”, a forerunner of the modern submarine. The Crimea mansion was constructed of local stone and embellished with a cupola and large eave pendants. Porches line the side and rear of the house. The mansion is now under the jurisdiction of the Department of Recreation and Parks, and is the headquarters for Outward Bound’s Baltimore program. A stable and chapel are among the original structures remaining in the park. The redwood stained chapel is the only ecclesiastical structure on the grounds of Crimea and one of the few examples of Carpenter Gothic architecture in the city. It was restored in 1988-1989 and can be rented for weddings. Like the mansion, it was built of stone and embellished with over-sized eave pendants.

Once again, many influential and prominent families have been and continue to be members of this church including former Mayor Kurt L. Schmoke. The church was named in honor of its first pastor Reverend Frederick Douglas. For many years Reverend Marion Bascom served as pastor and a prominent leader in Baltimore’s African American community.

The house is a simple, brick working-class dwelling, originally one half of a double house. It was built around 1825.  When Baltimore’s Housing Authority began its first slum clearance project, in 1938, the Poe House was spared and has since been restored and is maintained by CHAP.",,c. 1825,,T,Building,,Museum,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Allan_Poe_House_and_Museum,Federal,1,77,,checked,,"chap:38,habs:md1669",,,,N.

It was the third building erected by this volunteer fire-fighters group to house its equipment, and, in 1858, when the City established a paid Fire Department, the building was purchased for $8,000. It is the only engine house remaining from that era, unchanged, and now houses a fire museum. It is reminiscent of the days when volunteer fire companies  reached the peak of their rivalries and helped to give Baltimore its notorious name, “Mobtown”. Architecturally, the building is of the Italian Gothic style. Its 103 foot campanile, with its clock and series of pointed arches, has long been a familiar landmark to Baltimoreans.

It is the private cemetery of the Etting family, the first prominent Jewish family in colonial Maryland. Approximately twenty-five graves are on the site. The earliest dates from 1799, and the latest is dated 1881. Soloman Etting moved to Baltimore from York, Pennsylvania and gained prominence in shipping and other commercial ventures. He was instrumental in abolishing restrictions prohibiting Jews from holding public office in Maryland, and was one of the first Jewish members of the City Council. He was a founder of the B & O Railroad and a director of the Union Bank. Members of the Gratz and Cohen families married into the Etting family and are buried here also. Zalman Rehine who is said to be the first rabbi to immigrate to America is also buried here. Due to intermarriage, the Etting family disappeared from the Baltimore Jewish community. Today the property is maintained by the Baltimore Free Hebrew Burial Society. ",,c. 1799,,T,Cemetery,,,,,1,507,,checked,,chap:60,,,,W.

The house was purchased in 1878 by T. Harrison Garrett and remained in the family until 1942. The original structure with its alterations and extensions presents a splendid example of the living style which appealed to captains of American finance and industry from the period following the Civil War to the Great Depression. A Renaissance archway and large wing were added in 1885 by architect Charles L. Carson. The theatre was constructed and decorated by Leon Bakst in 1921; and Laurence Hall Fowler was responsible for several additons and alterations between 1922 and 1941, including redesigned the rear of the mansion for a library. The house is presently the home of Johns Hopkins University’s rare book collection and, together with the park and gardens, is maintained by the Evergreen Foundation.

In 1834, William Crane, a leather merchant from Richmond, Virginia, came to Baltimore. He had long been interested in missionary work among African Americans, and encouraged his friend from Virginia, Moses Clayton, to work in Baltimore.  Clayton, a freedman, founded a Sunday School soon after his arrival. In 1836 he was ordained a pastor and founded the First Colored People’s Baptist Church in a schoolhouse on the corner of Young and Thomsen Streets near Belair Market. The Church became a member of the Maryland Baptist Union Association in 1841. The Reverend Lewis Hicks, a pastor from 1865 to 1869, succeeded in increasing the membership to one hundred and replacing the old schoolhouse with a new church at the same location. The present structure, equally inspired by Classical and Federal architecture,  was built on a lot at the corner of Caroline and McElderry Streets that was acquired in 1875. The architects J. Appleton Wilson and William T. Wilson also designed the Divine Mission Apostolic Church, the McKim House, part of Belvedere Terrace, and many other houses throughout the Mt.

It is nationally famous for the quality of its Classical Revival design. The restrained rectangular structure of stuccoed brick and stone is enhanced by a well-proportioned portico crowned by a pediment on which is the figure of the Angel of Truth. This terra cotta sculpture is the work of Antonio Capellano, likewise the sculptor of the Battle Monument. Towering above the central portion of the church is a dome, 55 feet in diameter. The dedication of the church was held in 1818 and at that time, Dr. William Ellery Channing delivered a sermon which is still considered the keystone of Unitarian principles. Among the church's famous members was Rembrandt Peale. Jared Sparks, one of the early ministers, later became President of Harvard University.

Lexington Street was once a busy shopping hub for Baltimore and is a block away from the renovated Hippodrome Theater. The Baltimore Development Corporation (BDC) had hopes of this area being redeveloped as part of larger plan, known as the Superblock. A developer was selected for the redevelopment of the block bounded by West Lexington Street, North Howard Street, West Fayette Street, and Park Avenue. Unfortunately, that fell through and smaller developers are being sought. Two proposals have been presented by theatre companies. The Everyman Theatre would like to renovate a former furniture store on Howard Street for use as rehearsal space. Spotlighters is considering a move to the old Read’s Drugstore, where a failed attempt by Morgan State College students to be served at the lunch counter lead to the store’s desegregation policy in 1955.",,,,T,Block,,,,,,83,,,,,,,http://baltimoreheritage.org/issue/200-block-of-west-lexington-street/,,Downtown,http://www.openstreetmap.org/query?lat=39.291579&lon=-76.618834#map=19/39.291579/-76.618834,,,,Historic Resource Watchlist,T,44,,,F,996,9,B-1262,Market Center/Retail Historic District,,,Commercial,,https://explore.baltimoreheritage.org/items/show/83,Baltimore City,MD,"200 W.

Before its renovation, the building had been known as the Golden Horse, which was a lodging house as well as a stable. The renovated hotel had lodging apartments and chambers, parlors, a dining room and kitchen. The renovation likely met the demand of a growing population and more civilized clientele.

From 1714 to 1781 the Patapsco Meeting was held here at Friendship, part of the Darley Hall tract, until the meeting was moved to Aisquith Street. In 1805 the meeting was moved to Lombard Street. The log meeting house constructed at Friendship on Harford Road was abandoned. However, the area was continually used as a burial ground. In 1859, the Religious Society of Friends purchased land adjacent in order to expand.

Arriving in Baltimore in 1909, the Furness organization moved into the building in 1918, which was designed by E.H. Glidden, the architect of the Washington Apartments on Mount Vernon Place.  Furness House, with its consciously English design, is the product of the same brand of early-20th-century nationalism which inspired the design of the North German Lloyd Line’s Hansa House, and the Canton Company’s Canton House.

For nearly 200 years artisans here have hammered out practical and ornamental ironwork that still graces such local landmarks as Otterbein Methodist Church, the Basilica of the Assumption, Washington Monument, Zion Church, Johns Hopkins Hospital and the Baltimore Zoo. The modest beginnings of the shop date back to 1810, when farmers traveling to and from the market stopped to have their horses shod and their wagons repaired by blacksmith Andrew Merker, who, in turn, sold to Gustav A. Krug, a young Bavarian immigrant and ancestor of all the subsequent Krug family owners.

Architecturally it is one of the best examples of collegiate Georgian Revival in Baltimore, as well as being the cornerstone for the original Homewood campus plan and the work of a firm (Parker & Thomas) that was very active in Baltimore during the 1900s and 1910s. In 1904,  J. Harleston Parker and Douglas H. Thomas received the commission to design the new Homewood Campus.  Gilman Hall takes its structural motif from Homewood House, the Georgian structure located on the campus grounds. As Julia B. Morgan, Johns Hopkins University archivist stated in the “History of Homewood Campus:  A Walking Tour” Gilman Hall’s Georgian Revival Style, based on Homewood House, “influenced the architecture of the whole campus.” Gilman Hall’s tower bells are also worthy of note as the product of the McShane Bell Foundry Company, one of the oldest operating bell foundries in the country. Gilman Hall has social and cultural significance as a major building of the Johns Hopkins University, an institution which plays an important role in the history of American education. Hopkins was the first university in the country to devote itself to graduate research. As such it seems especially noteworthy that the main architect of Gilman Hall, Douglas H.

The building suffered from two major fires during its history; the first on Christmas Day in 1890 and the second in January 1908 which destroyed much of the interior. The firm of Carson & Sperry in 1893 carried out the restoration and Joseph Evans Sperry was responsible for the last additions and renovations in 1909. It was Sperry that was largely responsible for the ornate of interiors. The Temple stands today having been completely renovated and the ornate rooms restored and made available to the public as part of the Tremont Hotel. The late architect Michael Murphy guided the recent restoration. Several of Baltimore’s most notable historic architects and firms contributed to the design and restoration of this building. ,Masonic Grand Lodge,1866-1867; 1893; 1909,,T,Building,Edmund G.

His family moved into the house in 1883 when it was new, and the author spent most of his adult life here where he did most of his writing. Architecturally, it is significant on two counts. First, the structure is a relatively unaltered example of the typical brick front, marble trim, three-story row house of the late 19th century for which Baltimore is famous. Secondly, it is part of an unbroken row facing Union Square, one of the few 19th-century residential squares still retaining its original character.",,c. 1883,,T,Building,,,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._L._Mencken_House,Italianate,1,12,,checked,,chap:33,,,,Hollins Street,,http://www.openstreetmap.org/query?lat=39.287512&lon=-76.641698#map=19/39.287512/-76.641698,,,,CHAP Landmarks List (Revised),,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://explore.baltimoreheritage.org/items/show/12,Baltimore City,MD,"1524 Hollins Street, Baltimore, MD 21223",,,,,,,checked,Union Square-Hollins Market Historic District,T,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,checked,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was built for Dr. John Hanson Thomas, the great-grandson of John Hanson, President of the Continental Congress, and was the height of elegance and convenience. Such renowned guests as the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII) and General Kossuth visited it. In 1892, Mr. and Mrs. Francis M. Jencks purchased the home and remodeled it extensively under the direction of Charles A. Platt. The graceful circular staircase was widened and the oval Tiffany skylight installed in the coffered dome. The bow window in the dining room was added and the entire house was decorated in the Italian Renaissance style. Following the deaths of Mr. and Mrs. Jencks, the house was used as headquarters for various civic organizations and fell into a state of neglect and disrepair. Mr. Harry Leo Gladding purchased the building in 1963 and painstakingly restored it to its former elegance. It was later purchased by Willard Hackerman and donated to the Walters Art Gallery, which restored it to house its Asian Art Collection.

It was designed specifically for their German tenant Albert Schumacher and Co., shipping agents for the North German Lloyd Steamship Company, headquartered in Hamburg and Bremen, Germany. Labeled as a “Picturesque Edifice For [the] Heart Of Baltimore” in the Sun, the structure was designed according to specific instructions provided by Paul Hilken, an officer of the shipping agency. Modeled after a medieval courthouse in Halberstadt, Germany, the Hansa Haus is a 2 ½ story, brick and stucco, half-timbered structure. The building was symbolically named “Hansa Haus” in honor of the Hanseatic League or “German Hansa”, a medieval trade confederation  of  independent German city-states. The coats of arms of those cities were painted on the building above the first story level, along with a carved panel depicting a ship under full sail which represented the logo of the Hanseatic League. The Hansa Haus is one of the most unique structures in Baltimore and is reflective of the German heritage of many Baltimore citizens. ",,1911,,T,Building,"J. Harleston Parker,Douglas H.

William Fuld was also the holder of 45 patents, including some related to the Ouija Board, and manufacturer of several other games and toys. In 1927 William Fuld tragically fell from the roof of the building and died. The company was run by Fuld’s descendents until 1966 when they sold it to Parker Brothers.

The building exemplifies how architecture accommodated the evolution of department store commerce. The Hecht Company building weaves together the history of three major department store companies: the Bernheimer-Leader Store, the Hecht Company and the May Company. Designed by Wilson Levering Smith and Howard May, the building at 118 N. Howard Street was built for the Bernheimer-Leader Store in 1924. In 1927, the building was sold to the May Company, a Midwest retailer. In 1958, the May Company merged with the Hecht Company which remodeled the building in 1959 and 1960. By 1985, the Hecht Company downsized the store and added three floors of office space. Several years later the Hecht Company permanently closed their downtown location. The Hecht Company has been converted into apartments. ",,1924,,T,Building,"Smith & May,Wilson Levering Smith,Howard May",,,Commercial,1,112,checked,checked,,chap:103,,,,N.

Completed in 1888 to the designs of E. Francis Baldwin and Josias Pennington, one of the city’s most important architectural firms of the period, the south bay was added in 1924 as a compatible expansion of the retail sales space, and the ground floor was redesigned to the Art Moderne detailing as part of the 1931 expansion of the Hutzler’s complex. The ground floor visually and physically unites the Palace Building and the adjacent Hutzler’s Tower Building. In 1858 Abram Hutzler, too young to do business in his own name, used his father’s name and credit to open a small retail shop on Howard Street, which he called M. Hutzler and Son. His father Moses, a German immigrant, was never connected with the management of the store, but brothers Charles and David joined and formed the partnership of Hutzler Brothers. The store was located at the corner of Clay and N. Howard Streets on part of the site of this structure. Hutzler’s rapidly grew in importance to the commercial community of Baltimore, and in 1874 took over an existing three story structure two doors south of the Clay Street store, opening a “One Price Store” when bargaining was the rule. The 1888 Palace Building replaces both of these earlier buildings.",,1888,,T,Building,"Baldwin & Pennington (E.

The interior is noteworthy and exemplifies store design of the era.

The mansion is thought to have been built by Thomas Canby, a Baltimore spice merchant, who owned the sixty acre estate from 1860-1867 and named it “Radnor Park”. Around 1930, the main building’s Victorian character was altered with the removal of its cupola and mansard roof, and the addition of a classical portico and one-story wing. In 1910 the estate was bought and conveyed to the Hospital for Crippled Children by the philanthropist James Kernan, who also willed the institution most of his fortune made from operating burlesque and legitimate theatres. Kernan’s gesture stemmed from an appeal made to him by the hospital directress for the loan of a piano from one of his theatres for the patients’ recreation.",,1860-1867,,T,Building,,Health care facility,,Folk Victorian; Neoclassical,1,,,checked,,chap:63,,,,North Forest Park Avenue,,http://www.openstreetmap.org/query?lat=39.31418403&lon=-76.70814547#map=19/39.31418403/-76.70814547,,,,CHAP Landmarks List (Revised),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Baltimore City,MD,,,,,,,,checked,,F,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He was born at 622 Milton Avenue in 1911, and at the age of fourteen left school to become a travelling entertainer and master magician, then joined the Ringling Brothers, Barnum and Bailey circus. In 1931, Johnny became an actor in Tod Browning’s classic movie Freaks, which helped him to become a local legend in Baltimore. Later in his life, Johnny began to paint window and door screens, with William Octavec, the man who started the tradition in 1913, as his mentor and employer. Johnny passed away in 1991 in the same house where he was born. The house is currently owned by Jeffrey Gordon, who plans on eventually housing a museum chronicling the life of Johnny Eck.

Located in what is now called the “Market Center,” the Kresge building is comparable to the Hutzler’s building on Howard Street in Art Deco styling, simply on a smaller scale. The three story corner structure consists of two sections, the 1938 Art Deco structure, and a 1955 addition designed by Emil G. Jehle. No specific architect is credited for the Art Deco structure. Several other Kresge locations from around this period have a similar appearance, most likely a staff architect designed the structures.

It is the second oldest church building in Baltimore continuously occupied by the same African American congregation, and ministered to the needs of one of the earliest settlements of free African Americans in the City. The neighboring areas of Sharp-Leadenhall and Otterbein are rich in African American  history, but many of the buildings which housed the people and institutions intimately associated with the advancement of African Americans since the Civil War have been demolished. Leadenhall Baptist Church is one of the rare survivors. The church was designed and built by Joseph B. Thomas and Son, who owned and operated a planning mill on Leadenhall Street near Montgomery. Thomas, a Baptist, manufactured “moldings, pews, pulpits, altar rails, Gothic windows, etc.” from the 1860s through the end of the 19th century. The Thomas family commissions included the City Council chambers of Baltimore City Hall (George  A. Frederick, 1867-1875), and the interiors of Grace Methodist Episcopal Church (now Metropolitan United Methodist, Frank E. Davis, 1874) and First English Lutheran Church (now New Shiloh Baptist, Frank E. Davis, 1874). ",Leadenhall Street Baptist Church,1872,,T,Building,Joseph B.

As the population shifted, the congregation dwindled and the building was put to other uses. It had a Lithuanian Roman Catholic congregation from 1889 to 1905. When it was about to be demolished in 1960, the Jewish Historical Society purchased it and restored the synagogue as a museum. Many of the historical features of the building remain, including the wooden pews, women’s balcony, the cast iron fence and the blue and white cuspidors.

Goucher, founder and president of Goucher College, was the pastor at the time the church was erected.  Although this building is the fifth home of its congregation, it is revered as the ""Mother Church of American Methodism"" because of Christmas Eve, 1784, in the original Lovely Lane Meeting house, the Methodists gathered to organize their scattered churches into a single national body.

The Macht Real Estate and Banking business was founded by Ephraim Macht, the first Jewish real estate broker in Baltimore. The business is one of the oldest real estate and construction businesses still practicing in Baltimore and has been in the Macht Building since 1908. Macht Real Estate and Welsh Construction Company contributed greatly to urban development in Baltimore during the 20th century by building over eight thousand homes. The Macht Building is one of the first buildings A.L. Forrest designed in Baltimore and is one of the few such well preserved, exuberantly detailed, left in the Financial District. The Macht Building’s most distinctive architectural building feature is its mansard roof which is one of only three built on a commercial building in the city after the fire of 1904. Other elaborate details of the Building include enriched Ionic entablatures, Greek fretwork, an elaborate arched portal, cartouches, enriched consoles, termini and lions heads. Its condition is excellent and the building has had no significant exterior changes since it was built in 1908.",,1908,,T,Building,A.L.

Long a dream of John McKim, a successful Quaker merchant, it became a reality through his bequest of $600 annually for its support to be administered by the Society of Friends. The school flourished as a charitable institution until the spread and gradual improvement of public education at the turn of the century.  It then became a free kindergarten, the first in the city, serving largely the immigrant children of the neighborhood.  The building, designed by William Howard and William F. Small, reflects the popular interest in Greece during the 1820s, and it served as a model for other school architecture in the City.

Cade Armory represents 128 years of history of African American units of the Maryland National Guard. In 1879 former slaves and Union veterans, among others, organized themselves into the Monumental City Guard and were officially accepted as the First Separate Company, a separate Maryland National Guard regiment in 1882. In 1947, the First Separate Company became the 231st Transportation Truck Battalion with the 147th, 165th, and 726th Transportation Truck Companies. The 231st Transportation Truck Battalion became the only Maryland National Guard unit ordered to active duty to support the Korean War in 1950 and the first United States National Guard unit to set foot in Korea that same year. The 231st Truck Battalion efforts helped to racially integrate the Maryland National Guard. On November 21, 1955, Major General Milton A. Reckord, the Adjutant General, issued General Order Number 49 integrating the Maryland National Guard effective December 1, 1955 only after a long, persistent campaign from the 231st Transportation Truck Battalion.",,1959,,T,Building,,,,Modernist Institutional,1,,,checked,,chap:150,,,,Winchester Street,,http://www.openstreetmap.org/query?lat=39.3020568&lon=-76.65994426#map=19/39.3020568/-76.65994426,,,,CHAP Landmarks List (Revised),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Baltimore City,MD,,,,,,,,,Edmonson Avenue Historic District,F,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For years it was the only burial ground for Baltimore African Americans. Founded in 1872 by Rev. James Pack and the Memorial United Methodist Church (Sharp Street Church), Mount Auburn was a protest to the segregation in white Methodist churches at the time. In addition to the runaway slaves, the cemetery contains William Ashbie Hawkins, one of the first African American bishops in the African Methodist Church; Joseph Ganns, the first Black lightweight boxing champion of the world and civil rights activists, lawyers, doctors, teachers, and the loved ones of thousands of African American families.

The house, designed in a five-part Palladian plan, sits on a wooded rise and is surrounded by gardens. Though unoccupied by about 1840, the property was held by the Barrister’s family until 1840, when the City succeeded as owners. In 1910, the City constructed modern versions of the former gable-roofed wings, which had apparently been destroyed by 1860 for unknown reasons. The new wings were designed by J.B.

Royal Station and shed were built in 1896 and operated as a passenger station until 1961 when the railroad ceased passenger service into the station. The station and contiguous shed were constructed soon after the Howard Street Tunnel and are situated at the tunnel’s northern portal. The three structures were built to allow the B & O to compete for the  growing passenger service in the northeast corridor.  The Italian  Renaissance style building which is dominated by a 150-foot clock-tower, has become a prominent visual landmark at the juncture of two neighborhoods. In 1966 the Maryland Institute College of Art bought the property and employed Cochran, Stephenson and Donkervoet, to design the celebrated adaptation. It has received national recognition as a brilliant solution to recycling a railroad station. Other buildings designed by E. Francis Baldwin and Josias Pennington include the B & O Mt. Clare Shops (demolished 1976), the B & O Railroad Building, the Maryland Club, and Old City College. ","Mount Royal Trainshed, Baltimore & Ohio Railroad",1896,,T,Structure,"Baldwin & Pennington (E.

Although Fowler advocated the octagon shape primarily for domestic structures, it was often adapted to other uses. The  Mt. Washington Octagon, one of Baltimore’s last remaining examples of the style, was built under the direction of the Reverend Elias Heiner of the German Reformed Church and was used until 1861 as the Mt. Washington Female Academy. After the Civil War the college failed and the building was bought by the Sisters of Mercy, who opened Mount St. Agnes College. The college was expanded over the years to include 129 acres and several more buildings. In 1971, Mount St. Agnes merged with Loyola College and moved from the Mt. Washington site.  U.S.F. & G. purchased the property in the early 2000s and upgraded the campus, including restoration of the Octagon. The property is now a conference center for Johns Hopkins University.

Samuel F.B. Morse’s first telegraph message was transmitted through Mt. Clare to Baltimore on May 24, 1844. The Roundhouse (1884) and the Annex (1891) were both designed by E. Francis Baldwin. The Roundhouse, with its unusual 22-sided circular construction, still contains the original tracks and wooden turntable. Here Peter Cooper constructed his famous steam locomotive, the Tom Thumb. A replica is on display as well as other rail equipment, making up the largest historic rail exhibit in the world. The Annex, originally the employee’s library, houses smaller exhibits.

Located at 1201 Harford Avenue, the church was originally constructed as a simple Greek Revival structure for the Harford Avenue M.E. Church by master builder J.W. Hogg. In 1874, the congregation hired architect Norval W. Wall to significantly remodel the structure with Victorian architectural motifs. Wall added the tower, raised the basement by four feet, re-plastered and re-frescoed the main sanctuary, and replaced the seating. ",,1850; 1874,,T,Building,"J.W. Hogg,Norval W.

In 1914 they merged with the Broadway German M. E. Church and the combined groups took the new name First German M. E. Church.

Designed by Robert Cary Long, Jr. in the Tudor-Gothic style, it was one of the first major buildings in Baltimore to break from the Neoclassical mode. The church is one of a small group of American churches with a double tower and a center gable. The tracery in the stained glass windows is entirely cast in iron that was locally produced. Ten years after the Church was constructed, a parsonage, designed by R. Snowden Andrews, was constructed on the lot directly north of the Church, facing Cathedral Street. The gabled, Victorian-Gothic structure was designed to complement the Church. The church is now the Bread of Life Cathedral.",,1847; 1857,,T,Building,"R.

At Dunbar, there is a legacy of the community demanding equitable, high-quality education in quality school buildings - with the community, faculty, and students taking part at different points in its history. The school also served a crucial role in the community, particularly during segregation, as a site for recreation and social events.

Designed in 1926 by R.E. Lee Taylor and D. K. Este Fisher of the Baltimore office of Parker, Thomas, and Rice and expanded in 1956 by the same architects, the building embodies the Second Renaissance Revival style popular in the early 20th century. Its distinctive design, because no other commercial building in downtown Baltimore, except for perhaps Provident Bank, is based upon an early Italian Renaissance Florentine Palazzo. It is also distinctive because the top nine stories are modernistic in style, while at the same time they harmonize with the existing design. The result is a significant, educating juxtaposition of architectural styles, which very few other commercial structures possess in the city. Moreover, there is no better example in the city of early-20th-century bank design, especially as applied to a small bank. The exterior possesses monumentality and dignity, and the interior possesses the grandeur and magnificence of scale combined with the rich detailing that bankers preferred. Only three other banks have a main banking room of comparable scale, detail, and integrity. Finally, the bank is an example of a small urban banking building: a building type which flourished in the early 20th century in America and especially in Baltimore.

Many of Baltimore’s most prominent early citizens were buried in this cemetery including John Eager Howard, Revolutionary War hero, and Samuel Chase, one of Maryland’s four signers of the Declaration of Independence. Francis Scott Key and Tench Tilghman, General Washington’s aide-de-camp, were buried here until 1860. The cemetery also yields important information about burial customs, death rate, infant mortality, funerary art and local history, particularly in the early 19th century. By the late 1830s, St. Paul’s conservative attitudes towards death and burials became outdated which began a push outside the church for a more rural, non-sectarian and democratic cemetery. As a result, Greenmount Cemetery was established in July 1839, which had a devastating effect on the future of Old St. Paul’s Cemetery. The cemetery has improved considerably since its decline in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and has become a showplace which serves as an excellent example of preservation of an urban cemetery.

The present church was designed by Frank Davis and considered to be a grand architectural addition to Baltimore with its eclectic mix of Renaissance details.

It was built between 1785-1786 for a congregation of Germans who, under the leadership of Pastor Philip Wilhelm Otterbein, had separated from the Lutheran Church. In 1789, in this building, the Church of the United Brethren was organized and Pastor Otterbein was elected bishop. Now the church is part of the United Methodist denomination, following a merger in the 1960s. The building is architecturally unique. Its octagonal cupola is reminiscent of the work of the English architect, Christopher Wren. Much of the original glass remains in the arched windows. The nails throughout the building were handmade and the bells, cast in Germany and installed in 1789, are still in use. Pastor Otterbein's grave is in the churchyard, marked by a monument erected 100 years after his death.

It was during this time that the structure was used as a farm house and a tavern. In the mid-19th century, a 2½ story back ell with a central Gothic style dormer was added to the house. In the addition, a central dormer and Gothic style porch front was added. At this time the property was still used as a residence and the 1862 deed record mentions the “lager beer establishment.” In 1913 the property was sold to the Gundry family who opened a sanitarium.

The first was the Old Ashmolean Museum erected in 1682 at Oxford University. Robert Cary Long, Sr. was the architect for Peale's Gallery. Founded as an ""elegant Rendezvous for taste, curiosity and leisure,"" it was an institution devoted to science as well as  art. Peale's demonstration of gas illumination led to the founding of the Gas Light Company of Baltimore in 1817. When Peale sold the building to the City in 1830, it became Baltimore's first City Hall. In 1876, the #1 Negro Grammar School opened there. The school was later expanded to include a high school curriculum and teacher-training courses. Restored and opened to the public in 1931 as ""the Museum of the Life and History of Baltimore,"" it once displayed a large collection of prints, paintings, photographs, etc. concerning Baltimore history as well as important paintings by members of the Peale Family. The Peale Museum was operated as part of the privately incorporated City Life Museum which merged with the Maryland Historical Society. As of the date of this printing, contents of the Museum have been transferred to the Maryland Historical Society and the Museum is closed.",Municipal Museum of Baltimore; Rembrandt Peale Museum,1814; 1930,,T,Building,"""Robert Cary Long, Sr.""",Museum,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peale_Museum,Federal,1,78,,checked,,"chap:6,habs:md0143",,,,N.

The remaining portion of the station is the oldest surviving downtown passenger station in the United States. On April 19th, 1861 the first casualties of the Civil War took place as the Sixth Massachusetts Regiment walked along what is Pratt Street today, from the President Street Station to Camden Station. A mob began throwing rocks at the soldiers and the resulting fight caused the first deaths of the Civil War. This station was also the first to be constructed with the Howe trust arch system. Patented in 1841 by William Howe, it became the premier method for constructing train sheds and bridges for many years. The station is a documented site of the National Park Service’s Underground Network to Freedom, a collection of certified Underground Railroad sites. Several enslaved people escaped on this train line; most famously, Frederick Douglass jumped from a train destined for this station in Canton.

Provident Bank Building (Provident Bank of Maryland),240 N. Howard Street,240 ,Baltimore,,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/240 N. Howard Street, Baltimore, MD",39.29272803,-76.61984180,,2017-05-03 12:11pm,"The Provident Bank Building (originally Provident Savings Bank) is probably the finest example of the Second Renaissance Revival style in Baltimore. Designed to resemble Italian Renaissance palaces, this massive structure bears a remarkable similarity to Dahlgren Hall at the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, designed by Ernest Flagg in 1899 and completed in 1903, the year construction began on the bank building. Provident Savings Bank was chartered in 1886 to encourage “thrift and providence” among wage earners whose small deposits had not been sought after by the existing banks. Six branch offices was established at 407 E. Baltimore Street in April, 1887. In July 1888, the central office was moved to the corner of Howard and Franklin Streets, into a new building built especially for Provident. As the bank grew larger, it was recognized that the central office would soon be too small and a search was undertaken for a suitable corner lot in the downtown area. The search ended in 1901 with the purchase of the old Saratoga (Gibbons) Hotel lot on the southwest corner of Howard and Saratoga Streets. The present structure, begun in 1903 and completed in 1904, was designed by Joseph Evans Sperry, one of Baltimore’s most important and prolific architects, who has planned successful branch buildings for Provident, and by York & Sawyer of New York, architects of a number of major bank buildings, including the Riggs Bank of Washington. The central office was located in this building until recently, when Provident purchased the Old Federal Reserve Bank Building. In 1949 and 1953 the interior of this building was altered to provide additional space. ",,1903,,T,Building,Joseph Evans Sperry and York & Sawyer (Edward P.

The Raffel family was very prominent in the paper manufacturing business. Corrugated paper revolutionized the shipping industry in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In the 19th century, freight was shipped in wooden crates or barrels; but between 1850 and 1870, manufacturers began to replace these with paper bags and boxes. Paper container manufacturing originated the Midwestern states, but by the end of the 19th century, Baltimore’s paper container industry rivaled the Midwest. By 1902, paper packaging dominated the Baltimore container industry. Later, corrugated boxes were inextricably linked with both Baltimore’s glass and canning industries. J.M. Raffel Company was a successful manufacturer, remaining independent from a corrugated packing trust that attempted to monopolize the national market in the early 20th century. J.M. Raffel & Co. occupied the building through the 1920s. Hinde & Dauch, the Ohio company that pioneered the use of corrugated paper in 1897, acquired the Raffel Company and its property in the late 1920s.",,1911,,T,Building,,,,Industrial,1,,,checked,,chap:147,,,,W.

Riverside Park,301 E. Randall Street,301 ,Baltimore,,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/301 E. Randall Street, Baltimore, MD",39.26987150,-76.60733320,,2017-05-03 12:11pm,"Riverside Park is noteworthy for the involvement of its setting in the Battle of 1812 as well as its Victorian landscape design. The cannon memorial in the park is located near the crest where the Six Gun Battery defended Fort McHenry on the night of September 13, 1814 from an attack by 1,250 British soldiers on Fort McHenry. This history, so glorious in the minds of Baltimoreans, was reason enough for the City to purchase three acres in 1862 to create Battery Park. Another fourteen acres were purchased eleven years later and the park was renamed Riverside Park for its view of the Patapsco River. In 1881, the park was redesigned to meet Victorian ideals, with the addition of a large marble fountain, four drinking fountains, two pavilions, along with various shade trees and walkways. The Olmsted Brothers, who wanted a balance between active and passive recreation, added basketball and tennis courts and an outdoor gymnasium. The Riverside Park swimming pool was completed in 1925, and the marble fountain removed, signifying the shift from passive to active recreation. Today the park continues to be well used by many South Baltimore residents. ",,1862,,T,Landscape,,,,,1,187,,checked,,chap:136,,,,E.

Ann Street, Baltimore, MD",39.28222260,-76.59136170,,2017-05-03 12:11pm,"Robert Long didn’t settle in Fells Point by accident, but by design. As a merchant, it was natural for him to select this bustling seaport. The Point was acquired by a Quaker shipbuilder, William Fell, in 1731, and within a few years this colonial settlement had become a center of Revolutionary War commerce. Long himself may have helped to impress flour and provisions for the starving American Army. But the war brought some misfortune to Robert Long, who was forced to sell his warehouse by provincial court order; he later bought it back at a tidy profit. The 28-foot square, 2 ½  story house was laid out in a Quaker floor plan. Thickly glazed gray-green brick headers laid checkerboard-fashion in a Flemish bond pattern marked the facade as the only surviving example of this type of brickwork in Baltimore City. In fact, the Robert Long House is the oldest existing urban residence in Baltimore City. Preservation Society volunteers painstakingly removed two centuries worth of paint, wallpaper, and ceiling layers from each room, gradually revealing the original design. Foundation paint layers were chemically analyzed to determine the original color of each room. Much of the wide board paneling remained, as did the original staircase. Behind the walls are hand-split laths, packed with sturdy plaster made of burned oyster shells, using clumps of cow hair as a binder. The original Robert Long House had 2 ½ stories, but by raising the roof, this had been increased to three as the house changed owners. It has since been restored to its original configuration.

It is an integral component of Roland Park, one of the earliest planned, garden suburbs developed in this country.  Under the supervision of Edward H. Bouton, Roland Park was planned by two landscape architects, George E. Kessler, and later Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr. They planned the community to take advantage of the hilly topography. Because of the distance from Roland Park to downtown, it became evident that a shopping area would be a necessity to the community. The shopping center was designed by J.B. Noel Wyatt and William G. Nolting in the Tudor, half-timber style, one of the fashionable architectural forms of the late 19th century. This picturesque building with its decorative gables and dormers, tall chimneys and diamond-paned casement windows, is subject to the same restrictive covenants that regulate all the buildings in Roland Park.

The 148 foot tall, octagonal gray brick tower was built in 1904-1905 as part of a new water service system designed to distribute water to higher elevations east of the Jones Falls, pumped in from the Western Pumping Station at Druid Hill Park. Although now known as the Roland Park Water Tower, the historic name of the building is the Roland Water Tower, because it refers to Roland Avenue, not Roland Park since the tower did not originally supply water to the well-known planned suburb. The water tower was used until 1930, when the Department of Public Works switched service to the reservoir storage system. The most significant design of architect William J. Fizone, the water tower features more refined detailing and proportions than other water towers in Baltimore, such as the West Arlington Water Tower.

Baldwin was a principal in the firm of Baldwin and Pennington, an important local firm that designed many Baltimore buildings including the Maryland Club, Fidelity Building and Mount Royal Station. Saint Leo’s is a High Victorian Eclectic blend of Italianate and Romanesque elements. The building features an arcaded entrance porch, stained glass windows and a large tower which dominates the skyline of Little Italy. ",,1880-1881,,T,Building,E.

Baltimore was the first mission ground for the Society of St. Joseph, which sent four priests from England in 1871. The Josephite order was founded in Baltimore in 1873 and in 1888 bought the present St. Peter Claver property from the Whatcoat Methodist Episcopal Church. Since 1893 the order has been dedicated specifically to the aid and administration of African Americans. St. Peter Claver was a 17th-century Spaniard known as the “Apostle of the Slaves” in South America. In 1902 the present red brick Italianate church was added to the distinguished complex of buildings. St. Peter Claver Hall, damaged by fire in 1967, was the impressive Queen Anne styled building of Fuller Memorial Baptist Church, built in 1884 and designed by Architect William H. Marriott.

The school was named for Samuel Coleridge Taylor (1875-1912) who was an African-English composer and conductor in London. In 1829 the City of Baltimore opened their first schools. However, these schools were opened to white children only. Thirty-eight years later in 1867 the City of Baltimore passed an ordinance that provided education for African Americans in existing buildings. In the late 1890s, the City embarked upon another building campaign, in which several schools were built for African Americans. Although no elementary school was built until 1926, when ES #122, Samuel Coleridge Taylor School was built, designed by brothers Benjamin Courtland and Parke P. Flournoy. The school is a massive three-story building that is almost a block long. Three rows of almost sixty windows face Preston Street.

The building began as a gas filling station called the Continental Oil Company, built circa 1932. The Schwing Motor Service Sales and Service center was located behind the station, specializing in Ford automobiles. In 1936, the gas filling portion of the site was purchased by Vincent Schwing, who consolidated the operations into the Schwing Motor Service building. By the end of the Second World War in 1945 the gas station had ended and the site became dedicated to the sales and repair of the Hudson automobile. In 1947 Vincent Schwing decided to make additional changes to the site and commissioned F. J. Heldrich to design for him a suitable showroom. An Art Deco or Streamlined Moderne styled showroom was designed to evoke an image of the future and derived many of its forms from the high-speed transportation of the time like the airplane, the automobile, and the ocean liner. Minimal changes occurred to the exterior of the building for the next fifty years as the focus became imported vehicles. The building has been adaptively re-used as office space.

It was known as the Whatcoat Mission, so named because it met in an abandoned horse stable on Whatcoat Street. In 1900 the growing congregation became the Sharon Baptist Church. After a series of moves, the present structure, built in 1870 and acquired from the Whatcoat Methodist Episcopal Church, was bought in 1914. Since 1885, under the successive leadership of three outstanding pastors, Sharon has been instrumental in the advancement of blacks in Baltimore. During the pastorate of William M. Alexander (1885-1919) the precedent was set. The first school for African American children on Baltimore’s West Side was founded by Sharon. It is now School #112 at Calhoun and Laurens Streets, the William M. Alexander School. Reverend Alexander started and was the first editor of what is now the “Afro-American” newspaper. The building is a fine example of the local adaptation of Gothic Revival building forms, executed in brick, from the mid-19th century. ",,1870-1871,,T,Building,John W.

In 1797, African Americans gathered at 112-116 Sharp Street, where the Maryland Society for the Abolition of Slavery had opened Baltimore’s first day school for African Americans. The Society later abandoned this project and sold the lot and building in 1802 to the African American congregation, which then built a church on the property. The church played an important role in the local abolitionist movement and from 1867-1872, the Centenary Biblical Institute (now Morgan State University) held classes there. Following the migration of its congregation to northwest Baltimore, the church erected the present, stone Gothic building designed by Alphonsus Bieler in 1898. In 1921, Arthur M. Segoin, an African American architect, designed the adjacent Community House, the first of its kind in Baltimore.

The exterior walls featured excellent ornamentation, while the interior lobby and first floor retained the early-20th-century grandeur of a big city hotel. Architecturally, the building contributed to the early-20th-century character of the Financial District. Historically, this site housed important early hotels including the Fountain Inn, whose guests included George Washington, members of the Continental Congress and Francis Scott Key. The Carrollton Hotel was built on this site in 1870 and was destroyed in the Baltimore Fire. The Southern Hotel has housed many prominent guests including Presidents Theodore Roosevelt, Taft, Harding and Babe Ruth. The roof-top garden was a popular dancing spot during the first half of the 20th century. In the 1960s, the Southern Hotel was sold to an engineering school.

The Fathers hired architect Patrick C. Keely of Brooklyn, New York, to design their building. Born in Kilkenny, Ireland, Keely emigrated to the U.S. in 1841 and was already well established in New York by the time of his commission. It is estimated that he designed over 600 churches throughout the East Coast in his lifetime. The building he designed for St. Joseph’s was built of granite quarried from the St. Mary’s Industrial School nearby and was dedicated in 1868. Shortly afterward a new church was planned to replace the existing wooden one. Keely produced a Renaissance Revival style building of St. Mary’s granite which was connected to the corner tower of the monastery to form an “L”. The cornerstone was laid in 1881. In 1883, while the roofing work was being completed, the monastery was accidentally set afire and was completely gutted. The wooden top of the tower was also destroyed. A new monastery was designed by Keely was similar to the old, but larger. It was built of the same granite, between 1884 and 1886 and cost about $60,000. And hung with three bells. In the same year two statues, of St. Joachim and St. Anne, were placed in the niches of the church facade to flank the statue of St. Joseph, the monastery’s patron saint. They were carved by Professor Geelen of the Stoltzenberg Company of Roermond, Holland. Throughout its history the monastery has been active in community education, and constructed several school buildings and a convent which are just across the street, to the east of the complex, but not included in the landmark designation.

Built as a neighborhood parish church for the newly-built houses, the church captures the country feel of the neighborhood in the 1880s. Throughout Cassell’s career, he managed to design over a dozen Episcopal churches throughout Baltimore and Maryland. Today, the style of the building reflects the 19th-century character of the surrounding neighborhood, as well as the Gothic Revival influences. The parish was organized in 1891 as a mission of Mount Calvary Church and originally met at 1350 N. Calhoun Street. On November 24, 1899 the church formally opened on the corner of Gilmore and Presstman Streets. In June 1911 Saint Katherine’s parish moved into the current Chapel.

The parish, founded in 1879, grew out of the St. Stanislaus Kostka Society. In 1880, the parish acquired two lots on Ann Street in Fell’s Point and broke ground on their new church. The current Richardsonian Romanesque style church was built in 1889 on the site of the previous, smaller church. Subsequently, the parish constructed a school and a rectory, and helped form St. Casimir Catholic Church in Canton. In 1905, the church came under the control of the Franciscans who continued to run the church until 2005. It is being redeveloped as use for offices and a school.

Its unusual white Georgian tower punctuates the vista down Lexington Street from Charles and furnishes an interesting contrast with the modern office buildings now rising around it. It is also unique because the first priest-in-charge, Fr. Jean-Baptiste Gildea, was its designer. Architectural research indicates that a local carpenter-draftsman, perhaps John Hall, may have been the builder. The church was completed in 1814, becoming the fifth Catholic congregation in the city. In 1879, it was consecrated by Cardinal Gibbons. For many years, the parish was known for its Printers’ Mass, celebrated after midnight for the convenience of employees of the City’s newspapers. ",,1841,,T,Building,Rev.

After years of declining use, the Infant Asylum left the facility around 1934 for a new location on Reisterstown Road. Around 1941, the building was converted to use as Carver Hall Apartments, offering a range of rental units to a largely African American group of tenants from the Upton neighborhood. The management of the property has posed significant challenges for residents in the building since the 1970s, with a major fire in 1978, a lawsuit in 1993, and issues with drug traffic and violence at the building in the 1990s. The building was auctioned off in 2013, then caught fire in January 2015, destroying the roof and gutting much of the interior.

It is an excellent example of early-20th-century Beaux-Arts Classicism. This skyscraper is a reminder of the history of the oil refining industry in Baltimore. In 1865 the Merrritt Brothers built Baltimore’s first oil refinery plant. By 1877 there were at least six oil refinery plants in Baltimore under the sponsorship of the Standard Oil Company. However, by 1892, the Standard Oil Company owned all of the oil refineries in Baltimore. It had become an industry that comprised 50 acres in Canton. In 1922, the Standard Oil Company decided to build their southern headquarters on Saint Paul Street. In 2002, the building was converted into apartments. ",,1922,,T,Building,Clyde N.

The Taylor family, who owned a large plantation called Mt. Pleasant, converted to Methodism in the late 18th century. The present chapel was constructed in 1853, and became the center of Methodism for the surrounding countryside. The small Greek Revival building, sitting on a slight hill above Herring Run on the Mt. Pleasant Golf Course, is of simple frame construction and covered with stucco. The simple fresco work on the interior may have been done by Constantino Brumidi, an Italian immigrant who painted the frescoes in the Capital dome.  Brumidi was a guest of the Taylor’s at the time of the chapel’s construction. In 1925 the City of Baltimore purchased the chapel and burial ground, but the site has remained under the direction of a Board of Trustees from St. John’s Methodist Church of Hamilton. The Loch Raven Community Organization undertook the preservation of Taylor’s Chapel as their Bicentennial project.

Built between 1850-1858, the Mount was designed by William Reasin and is his best example of the Italianate Villa. The building’s materials are local stone quarried most likely from the Gwynns Falls. The Mount was built for James Carey, the grandson of the great abolitionist and builder of the Calverton Mill race. In the 1910s the estate was sold for the creation of the Fairmount neighborhood.

The Church was organized by Reverend John Carey with 57 members in 1852 in East Baltimore. In 1868 it moved to a new location on North Street near Saratoga Street. The congregation then moved to the Church’s present location on Druid Hill Avenue in 1905, in the building designed by William J. Beardsley of New York. Pastor Harvey Johnson arrived in 1874 to help greatly expand the congregation and found several new churches through 1923. However, he is mostly known for contributions to civil rights efforts. In 1883, Johnson organized the Brotherhood of Liberty to fight for the hiring of black teachers in the City’s public schools and the opening of the Maryland bar to blacks. He also helped found the Niagara Movement, and co-founded the NAACP Baltimore Chapter, and in 1897 he established the Colored Baptist Convention. One of his contemporaries, Dr. Baxter L. Matthews, established the Harvey Johnson Center on the Church’s property in 1955 and was also a cosponsor of 1963 March on Washington Movement, of which the Church housed the attendees. It was also a meeting place for the “Goon Squad”, an organization formed by Reverend Vernon Dobson to help elect African American politicians and organize many civil rights protests.",,1905,,T,Building,William J.

Its monumental and Classical design symbolized the commercial glory of America and the Port of Baltimore.  Baltimore’s original customs office was chartered in 1786, three years before the creation of the United States Customs. The present building replaced the quarters of the United States Customs that had existed from 1820-1900 on the same site in the Merchant’s Exchange, a building designed by Maximilien Godefroy and Benjamin H. Latrobe in 1816. In 1865 President Abraham Lincoln’s bier lay in state under the dome of the Merchant’s Exchange. This building was designed by Joseph C. Hornblower and John Rush Marshall, architects from Washington, D.C. The Call Room, where sea captains from around the world cleared their cargoes with customs officials, is decorated with murals by Francis Davis Millet. They depict a fleet of ships entering Baltimore’s harbor and an accurate visual history of the evolution of navigation. Considered to be among Millet’s finest, and a major significance in the history of American mural painting, the murals have recently been restored to their original splendor. The Customs House, which was converted into Federal offices in 1953, was designated as a “United States Customs Historical Landmark” on January 18, 1972.

It was built as the country residence of David Stewart, a prominent Baltimore attorney and politician. The name “Upton” is derived from an earlier residence that was built in the area in 1785 called “Upton Park.” Stewart purchased Upton Park in 1838 and built the existing Greek Revival house on the property. The architect is unknown, but it has been suggested that it may be the work of Robert Cary Long, Jr. Following Stewart’s death, Upton changed ownership a handful of times, mostly due to financial deficiencies, and in 1930 the property was purchased by Monumental Radio, Inc., the parent company of WCAO, Maryland’s oldest radio broadcaster. In 1947, Upton was then sold to the Baltimore Institute of Musical Arts, Inc., a pioneering music conservatory for African-Americans, founded by Dr. J. Leslie Jones. At the time, African Americans were not allowed to attend the Peabody Conservatory and this institution was to provide the same quality of musical education. The school closed in 1955 due to low enrollment. Following two other brief uses as a school, Upton is currently owned by the Department of Housing and Community Development.",Upton,1838,,T,Building,Robert Cary Long,,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upton_(Baltimore,_Maryland)",Greek Revival,1,5,,checked,,chap:138,,,http://baltimoreheritage.org/issue/upton-mansion/,W.

Mr. Walters, a Baltimore art collector and philanthropist, contributed four bath houses to the city even though he was living in New York City after 1894. Located at Washington Boulevard (then known as Columbia Avenue) and Callender Alley, this second bath house was built to serve congested neighborhoods in southwest Baltimore in the Parkin Street area. It is the only surviving bath house in Baltimore. Bathing establishments in Baltimore began as far back as 1800, when William Finn was keeper of the baths on the west side of Jones Falls. As a private enterprise, the service they provided was considered to be a luxury. Even though the bathtub began to be installed in homes during the second half of the 19th century, only 10% of the dwellings of Baltimore’s densely populated sections had them by the 1890s. Thus, the Walters Baths were the first such structures designed in Baltimore, not for recreation, but to provide an opportunity for cleanliness to all persons by offering them a shower, spray or tub bath, not swimming tank. The design of Walters Bath No. 2 was is a very simplified form of Renaissance Revival popularized at the turn of the century by architects such as McKim, Mead and White. In the Bath Commissioner’s report, the design is called ‘Free Colonial.’ The Bath is a small brick building of 40’x70’ 6” laid in Flemish bond with glazed headers and Maryland limestone trimming. It was designed by George Archer, a local architect. The designation of the adjacent Engine House #10 was added to the Walters Bath House landmark designation (#79) because it is an excellent example of an early 1870s Renaissance Revival-style firehouse. The fire station dates from 1872 and cost $12,000 to build. It was home to Engine #10, until the company moved in 1952. Later, it was once used as a branch of the Enoch Pratt Free Library. The building was heavily damaged in 1986 during a fire on the adjacent Scott Street.

The site was included in Baltimore’s 1910 Olmstead plan to centralize the City’s more significant buildings into a downtown Civic Center Plaza on the land between Saint Paul Street and the Jones Falls. The austere, Neoclassical design of the building is complemented by two sculptures of “Sea horses” which flank the portico-entrance. They are symbolic representations of “the might of America crossing the sea to come to the aid of the Allies”. Covering the west end of the interior balcony wall is a classical style mural by Baltimore-artist, R. McGill Mackall, depicting, “A Sacrifice to patriotism”.

In late May 2014, a retaining wall on the southern end of the Western Cemetery collapsed following a severe thunder storm. WJZ and WBAL both reported on the collapse at the time. The collapse dropped a flood of soil and debris down hill and blocked the Gwynns Falls Trail. Continued erosion at the site is dumping sediment into the Gwynns Falls with every storm. The Parks & People Foundation and the Gwynns Falls Trail Council secured partial funding from the Maryland Department of Natural Resource to stabilize the wall and eliminate the sediment pollution. Unfortunately, Baltimore City Department of Recreation and Parks and the Beechfield United Methodist Church have been unable to determine clear responsibility for the property boundaries and the required repairs to the retaining wall.",,1849,,T,Cemetery,,,,,,297,,,,,,,http://baltimoreheritage.org/issue/western-cemetery/,,Penrose/Fayette Street Outreach,http://www.openstreetmap.org/query?lat=39.291564&lon=-76.665808#map=19/39.291564/-76.665808,way,82576503,https://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/osm:way=82576503,"Historic Resource Watchlist,Baltimore Cemetery Inventory",T,44,,,T,748,9,,,,,Green Space,,https://explore.baltimoreheritage.org/items/show/297,Baltimore City,MD,"3001 Edmondson Avenue Baltimore, MD 21223",7TH,9,,,,,,,,checked,,,Private/Nonprofit,,Beechfield Methodist Church,cemetery,western-cemetery,Neglect,,,https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7335/16326931017_704b74e2e9_b.jpg,,,,,,checked,Draft Required,,N,"https://maps.google.com/?layer=c&cbll=39.291564,-76.665808","https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/streetview?location=39.291564,-76.665808&size=512x512&key=AIzaSyAJuUnhBMoimCcbU_x2--fECyOT_29DPgk",,,,0.203820,-4.847030,B-1376,

Zion Lutheran Church & Parish House,400 E. Lexington Street,140-146 ,Baltimore,21202,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/400 E. Lexington Street, Baltimore, MD",39.29155681,-76.60997272,,2017-05-03 12:11pm,"The Zion Lutheran Church, built 1807-08, is the second oldest house of worship in the City. The original occupants of the building were the Lutheran Germans of Baltimore, organized in 1755. In 1758, this young group purchased the grounds on which all of Zion’s buildings stand today. The architects, George Rohrback and Johann Machenheimer were two members of the congregation and also worked on St. Mary’s Seminary with Maximilien Godefroy. The design of the facade drew much criticism due to the mixed use of the Romanesque and Gothic architectural details. Originally the church was crowned with a small tower and had one front and side entrance each with round arches in the Romanesque style. The windows on the front of the building were in the Gothic, pointed-arch style. After a fire in 1840, which left only the walls intact, the windows on each side of the front entrance were converted into doors. The contrasting styles were maintained in the reconstruction. The church contains a progression of Art Nouveau and Victorian stained glass windows which was considered to be among the finest in Baltimore. Other outstanding artwork includes exquisite Tiffany studio lights in the domes and sidelights of the adjoining parish house, and tiles from Henry Mercer’s Moravian Tile Works. The parish house and tower, added to the church in 1912, were designed by Theodore Wells Pietsch, the architect of Baltimore’s Saints Phillip and James Church in Charles Village. The later additions are considered to be premiere examples of Arts and Crafts design.
