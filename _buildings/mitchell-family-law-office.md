Early owners of 1239 Druid Hill Avenue included Charles C. Cook and Herman S. Platt (mentioned [here](https://books.google.com/books?id=apEvAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA16-IA3&dq=%22Herman+S.+Platt%22+baltimore&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjisKbKksHWAhVGjJQKHT__DGgQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&q=%22Herman%20S.%20Platt%22%20baltimore)). The building served as legal offices for Juanita Jackson Mitchell and Clarence M. Mitchell as well as meeting space for the Baltimore chapter of the NAACP and, later, offices for the Lillie Mae Carroll Jackson Museums. The building has been vacant for a number of years and has suffered from significant neglect.
