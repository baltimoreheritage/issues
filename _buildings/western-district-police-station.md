In 1876, the Western District Station moved from its prior location on Greene Street between Baltimore Street and Belvidere Street to a new building on Pine Street. The police continued to use that location from 1876 up until August 31, 1959 when they opened a new station at Riggs Avenue and Mount Street (1034 N. Mount Street). The Western District Station is just one of several stations with near identical designs constructed in a major expansion by the Baltimore City Police Department.

On August 14, 1957, the _Baltimore Sun_ highlighted the Western District Police Station's construction on the site of a playground at Mount Street and Riggs Avenue as an example of how the city overrode the Baltimore Park Board as the city traded parkland for police stations.

>“Under the city charter the Park Board has “charge and control” of all park property. A guardian for the park system, with the power to say “no,” is needed because proposals to encroach on park property are being made all the time. Sometimes public interest justifies the proposals. Sometimes it does not. The Park Board is there to make such determinations, always with the welfare of the parks in mind. ...

>The city concluded that a playground at Fulton and Riggs avenues, for which the Park Board planned further development, would be the ideal site for a new police station. The Park Board was finally convinced, and co-operated. ...
>
> These are merely a few of the more conspicuous episodes in what might be called a continuous war of attrition against the parks. They point up the necessity for a semi-autonomous body with power to pass judgment on all schemes for reducing out precious park acreage.

>But now the authority of this body, the Park Board, has been defied. When the Mayor and City Council seized 30 acres of Druid Hill Park land for a civic center site, they did so against the will of the Park Board. If this seizure stands unchallenged, a shadow lies across the board’s supposed powers. The guardian of our park system will have been disarmed.

During the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, as local residents and activists organized around public safety and criminal injustice issues, the Western District Police Station was a regular site of protest. Examples from a limited search of the _Baltimore Sun_ ProQuest database include:
